<h4>Why am I eager to get an internship?</h4>
<p>
<b>It is the most efficient way to gain experience</b><br>
Knowledge is dead to me if I don't apply them. I have studied a lot of thoeries in college, I beleive I will learn how to put them into practice while interning. 
Also, I want to learn things I can't learn in college. I always wonder how things work in a real company. I want to know how professionals think and how they deal with problems.
Besides gaining professional experience, it's a pleasure to work with extraordinary people with great minds through an internship.
