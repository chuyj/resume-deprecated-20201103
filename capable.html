<h4>Am I eligible and capable to be an intern?</h4>
<p>
<b>I am happy to learn new things.</b> Although I do not have all the skills you need, but I am always willing to learn new things.<br>
Learning is not about getting good grades in school, the purpose of learning is learning itself.<br>
Many courses in college are very theoretical. That's why I like to learn how to apply them in my free time.
I believe I am eligible and capable to be an intern because I love to learn new things.
